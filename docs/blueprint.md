## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to evoke a sense of calm and professionalism.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) for a minimalist and neumorphic aesthetic.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#70DBD1) for interactive elements and subtle highlights.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used for both headlines and body text due to its modern and neutral appearance. This will give the UI a clean, readable feel suitable for financial data.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to maintain a clean and minimalist aesthetic.
- Implement a neumorphic UI design with soft shadows and inset elements to create a subtle 3D effect.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for a smooth and responsive user experience.
